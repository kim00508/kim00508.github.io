            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I studied fashion design and previously worked in the fashion industry. My role as a fashion technologist involved specializing in fitting garments and creating garments blueprints, know as patterns in fashion, using <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> computer programs. I enjoyed my work working with many global retail brands such as GAP, ZARA, and so on. </p>
            <p>Working in fashion was enjoyable, but I realized it might not be a long-term career path for me. I did not plan to leave the fashion industry forever. Instead, I wanted to broaden my skills for the future. So, I made the decision to enroll in a course on interactive media design to expand my skill set. My journey just started on the 6<sup>th</sup> of May 2024. Even though I am not sure how my previous career in fashion will align with there new skills in interactive media design, I am enjoying the journey. I would appreciate you teaching me.</p>
